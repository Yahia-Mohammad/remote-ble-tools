 * that many consecutive failed attempts the transport stops, rests at
 * [TransportState.DISCONNECTED], and invokes [onGaveUp] exactly once; `null` (the default) means
 * retry forever. A later successful (re)connection resets the count, so a subsequent drop gets a
 * fresh episode. This lets a caller distinguish "still reconnecting" from "gave up — surface an

/**
 * LAYER 1 over a Ktor WebSocket. Each protocol frame is one binary WS message.
 * The endpoint URL ("ws://host:port/path") is opaque to everything above this.
 *
 * [connect] is idempotent. If the *initial* attempt fails (e.g. the agent isn't up yet) and
 * [reconnect] is enabled, it arms the same [Backoff] loop instead of giving up — a client that
 * starts before its agent still connects once the agent appears, without the caller retrying.
 * With reconnect disabled, the initial attempt is one-shot and [connect] throws on failure.
 * On an unexpected close the transport goes DISCONNECTED (which makes the session fail in-flight
 * requests with TRANSPORT_LOST) and, if enabled, retries per [reconnect] until reconnected (or the
 * policy gives up) — at which point new requests succeed again. The incoming pipe survives reconnects.
 *
 * [authToken] is the Phase-7 auth hook: a suspend provider for the bearer credential.
 * It is invoked once per connection attempt (including every [Backoff] reconnect retry),
 * so a token that rotates or expires is refreshed on reconnect rather than replayed stale.
 * The SDK never caches the returned value and does not own the identity system; the provider
 * owns its own caching/expiry. If it throws, the attempt fails like any other connect error
 * and folds into the reconnect/backoff path. Return `null` (the default) — or a blank string — to
 * send no header, i.e. connect unauthenticated against a token-free agent.
 *
 * [clientId] is a *stable session id* generated once and re-sent on every reconnect, so the
 * agent recognises this client after a brief drop and lets it resume its peripheral ownership.
 * It is not a credential — it identifies, it does not authenticate.
