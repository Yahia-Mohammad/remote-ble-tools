 * peer always agree on the *intersection* of what they both name here.
 *
 * The negotiated set is `clientWanted ∩ agentSupported`, computed by the agent and
 * returned in [ServerHello.capabilities]. A capability absent from that set means the
 * corresponding ops will be answered with [ErrorKind.UNSUPPORTED] — clients should
