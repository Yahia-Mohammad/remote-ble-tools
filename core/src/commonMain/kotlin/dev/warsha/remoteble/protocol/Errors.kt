 * *error*, independent of the *operation*. A transient kind reflects a passing condition (a busy
 * radio, a dropped link, a full slot table); a non-transient one reflects a stable fact that a
 * retry cannot change (an unknown device, an unsupported op, a missing characteristic). It is the
 * error half of the retry decision; the operation half is [Op.isIdempotent] — a caller should
 * auto-retry only when *both* say yes (see `RetryPolicy` in the client SDK). Wire form is unchanged:
 * the enum serializes by name, so [transient] is a pure client-side annotation.
